 Short history
#################################

Experiments with one link are important to validate the linear model. We intend by linear model the
assumption that transmission time is correlated to size, bandwidth and latency in some way such as
T=S/B+L, for instance. More detailed description about this assumption and the evolution of the
SimGrid network engine is presented in[FIXME].

#################################
 Directory structure
#################################

This directory contain many files so they are organized in a directory structure as follows:

* ./log   - Tons of output generated by simgrid while running experiments
* ./dat   - The raw.dat file in an R input format
* ./tmp   - Temporary files, such as those generated by R when gnuplot is called within R
* ./bin   - Auxiliary scripts are stored here
* ./fig   - EPS images are generated inside this directory

#################################
 Running Experiments
#################################

#######################
- ./bin/sweep-parse.pl
#######################

File ./bin/sweep-parse.pl is the most important script it can run the entire set of experiments
using or not a grid/cluster infrastructure to improve simulation speed. Two parameters are used,
<first-task> <last-task>. Hence this script run all experiments from first-task up to last-task
including those number passed as parameters. Before running this script is important to correctly
set the working directory as your SimGrid gtnets binary location. All programs here use the gtnets.c
program this programs source is normally located in the experiments top directory.

After all log files are corrected collected in directory ./log this is script may be used to parse
results generating ./dat/raw.data which will contain all experiments in a R table format.

CAUTION: This script relies on parsing the output, so every modification (even slight ones) on the
program output may cause the parsing feature to unpredicted behavior. A gtnets.c version is stored
in the top level directory of experiments, this is a trusted version, if you are not sure about your
gtnets.c file please use the one distributed here.

- Example: Be aware that executing the script should overwrite stored output.

./bin/sweep-parse.pl sweep 1 1

This generate one output trace file for the first bandwidth parameter
in ./log/trace-file-1-1.log

./bin/sweep-parse.pl parse

To parse the output, after all log files have been collected.

#######################
- analyze.R
#######################

This file contain all the R function used to analyze the data in ./dat/raw.data. The ./dat/raw.data
file is generated by ./bin/sweep-parse.pl script as described before.

I'm used to analyze my data within emacs using ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistic) package.
