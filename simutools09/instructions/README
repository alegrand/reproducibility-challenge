 Short History
#################################

This directory hold experiment comparing the SimGrid framework network simulation engine with
GTNets. GTNets is a packet level network simulator and we believe it can provide realistic
transmission time prediction due to its characteristic of simulating through discrete events the
entire TCP protocol stack.  This work is the normal continuation of the work presented by Kayo
Fujiwara and Henry Casanova in [1] and was submitted to the SimuTools09 conference which is still to
be evaluated and accepted/reject.

#################################
 Directory Structure
#################################

Three category of experiments were performed. Each one was tackled separately and are organize in
distinct directories as follows:

* ./01-onelink  - Verify message size communication time correlation
* ./02-dumbbell - Bandwidth sharing experiments
* ./03-random   - Complex platforms to assure model improvements

#################################
 Global System Requirements
#################################

Experiments and analyze scripts are provided to reproduce the graphs presented in [FIXME(Rapport de
recherche ou reference simutools]. To run experiments some minimum system requirements are needed:

* GTNets patched simgrid version, we kindly provide GTNets with patches in the simgrid contrib svn
  repository [FIXME]
* SimGrid, configured and compiled with GTNets support [FIXME]

For plotting graphs and explore the data:

* R - the gnu version of S [FIXME]
* Gnuplot [FIXME]
